\section*{Original Aims of the Project}
The primary aim of the project was to implement and benchmark a variety of language models, comparing the quality of their predictions as well as the time and space that they consume. More specifically, I aimed to build an $n$-gram language model along with several smoothing techniques, and a variety of recurrent neural network-based language models. An additional aim was to investigate ways to improve the performance of existing language models on error-prone text.

\section*{Work Completed}
All of the project aims set out in the proposal have been met, resulting in a series of language model implementations and a generic benchmarking framework for comparing their performance. I have also proposed and evaluated a novel extension to an existing language model which improves its performance on error-prone text. Additionally, as an extension, I implemented a mobile keyboard on iOS that uses my language model implementations as a library.

\section*{Special Difficulties}
None.

\chapter{Introduction}

My project investigates the performance of various language models in the context of text prediction. I started by implementing a series of well-established models and comparing their performance, before assessing the tradeoffs that occur when you attempt to apply them in a practical context, such as in a mobile keyboard. Finally, I propose a novel extension to an existing model which aims to improve its performance on error-prone text.

\section{Language Models}

Language models (LMs) produce a probability distribution over a sequence of words, which can be used to estimate the relative likelihood of words or phrases occurring in various contexts. This predictive power is useful in a variety of applications. For example, in speech recognition, if the speech recogniser has estimated two candidate word sequences from an acoustic signal \tit{`it's not easy to wreck a nice beach'} and \tit{`it's not easy to recognise speech'}, then a language model can be used to determine that the second candidate is more probable than the first. Language models are also used in machine translation, handwriting recognition, part-of-speech tagging and information retrieval.

\begin{alignat*}{2}
	\overbrace{\tit{Do you want to grab a }}^{w_1^k}&\overbrace{\underline{\tit{drink}}}^{w_{k+1}} &&\hspace{0.5mm}\overbrace{(0.327)}^{\mathbb{P}(w_{k + 1} | w_1^k)} \\
	&\tit{coffee} &&\ \ (0.211) \\
	&\tit{bite} &&\ \ (0.190) \\
	&\tit{spot} &&\ \ (0.084) \\
	&\vdots &&\ \ \vdots
\end{alignat*}

My project focuses on language modelling in the context of text prediction. That is, given a sequence of words $w_1w_2...w_k = w_1^k$, I want to estimate $\mathbb{P}(w_{k + 1} | w_1^k)$. For instance, if a user has typed \tit{`do you want to grab a '}, then a language model could be used to suggest probable next words such as \tit{`coffee'}, \tit{`drink'} or \tit{`bite'}, and these predictions could further be narrowed down as the user continues typing.

\section{Motivation}


\subsection*{Benchmarking}

\begin{itemize}
\item
	Variety of language models, that vary in accuracy, memory consumption and speed.
\item
	Combinations can be considered.
\item
	Important tradeoffs when applying them to mobile.
\end{itemize}

There are two prominent approaches to language modelling, the first of which is the $n$-gram approach and the second of which is based on (recurrent) neural networks.

 language models and their various smoothing techniques, before proceeding onto neural network-based language models. Combinations of such models, which can be achieved by interpolating their probability distributions, will also be included in the benchmark. \\

New techniques for facilitating better predictions are constantly being developed for language models. However, it is important to realise that such models are being used increasingly in a mobile environment, where the computational and memory resources aren't as abundant.

\subsection*{Error-prone Text}

One problem with existing language models is that their next-word predictions tend to be less accurate when they are presented with error-prone text. This isn't surprising, because they are only ever trained on sentences that do not contain any errors.

Unfortunately, humans are not perfect, and they will make typographical mistakes, spelling mistakes and occasionally grammatical errors too. In this project I investigate ways to bridge the gap in performance between language model predictions on error-prone text and error-free text.

\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter, I will first describe the benchmarking framework that I built to evaluate the language models, before proceeding onto the results. The results section is threefold: firstly I will present the performance of the existing language models that I implemented, secondly I will focus on the tradeoffs faced when employing those models on a mobile device, and finally I will display my findings in language modelling on error-prone text.

\section{Evaluation Methodology}

\subsection{Metrics}

In the context of text prediction, there are essentially two questions one might want to answer when evaluating a language model:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
	How accurately does the language model predict text?
\item
	How much resource, such as CPU or memory, does the language model consume?
\end{enumerate}

In order to answer these questions, I implemented a generic benchmarking framework that can return a series of metrics that fall into one of the two aforementioned categories when given a language model. These metrics include perplexity, average-keys-saved, memory usage and average inference time. The first two are concerned with the accuracy of language models and the latter two relate to the resource usage.

\subsubsection{Perplexity}

Perplexity is the most widely-used metric for language models, and is therefore an essential one to include so that my results can be compared with those of other authors. Given a sequence of words $w_1^{N} = w_1w_2...w_N$ as test data, the perplexity PP of a language model $L$ is defined as:
\begin{gather}
	\text{PP}_L(w_1^N) = \sqrt[N]{\frac{1}{\mathbb{P}_L(w_1^N)}} = \sqrt[N]{\prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{\mathbb{P}_L(w_i | w_1^{i-1})}}
\end{gather}
where $\mathbb{P}_L(w_i | w_1^{i-1})$ is the probability computed by the language model $L$ of the word $w_i$ following the words $w_1^{i-1}$. The key point is that \tbf{lower values of perplexity indicate better prediction accuracy} for language models trained on a particular training set. \\

This somewhat arbitrary-looking formulation can be better understood from a touch of information theory. In information theory, the cross-entropy $H(p, q)$ between a true probability distribution $p$ and an estimate of that distribution $q$ is defined as:\footnote{Note that $H(p, q)$ is often also used to denote the joint entropy of $p$ and $q$, which is a different concept.}
\begin{gather*}
	H(p, q) = -\sum_x p(x) \log_2 q(x)
\end{gather*}
It can be shown that $H(p, q) = H(p) + D_{KL}(p || q)$ where $D_{KL}(p || q) \geq 0$ is the Kullback-Leibler distance between $p$ and $q$. Generally speaking, the better an estimate $q$ is of $p$, the lower $H(p, q)$ will be, with a lower bound of $H(p)$, the entropy of $p$. \\

The perplexity PP of a model $q$, with respect to the true distribution $p$ it is attempting to estimate, is defined as:
\begin{gather}
	\text{PP} = 2^{H(p, q)}
\end{gather}

Language models assign probability distributions over sequences of words, and so it seems reasonable to use perplexity as a motivation for a measure of their performance. In the context of language modelling, however, we do not know what the underlying distribution of $p$ is, so it is approximated with Monte Carlo estimation by taking samples of $p$ (i.e. sequences of words from the test data) as follows:
\begin{gather*}
	\text{PP}_L(w_1^N) = 2^{-\frac{1}{N}\sum_i \log_2 \mathbb{P}_L(w_i | w_1^{i-1})}
\end{gather*}
With a little algebra, this can be rearranged to give equation (4.1). \\

One issue with perplexity is that it is undefined if $\mathbb{P}_L(w_i | w_1^{i-1})$ is 0 at any point. To get around this in my implementation, I replaced probability values of 0 with the small constant \ttt{1e-9}. Results that use this approximation are marked.

%\subsubsection{Guessing Entropy}~\\
%If a language model $L_1$ has assigned a higher probability to the correct next word $w_c$ than another language model $L_2$, then it does not necessarily follow that $w_c$ is ranked higher in the predictions of $L_1$ than in the predictions of $L_2$.\footnote{To see this, consider the following example: $L_1$ and $L_2$ both have a vocabulary of 5 words; $L_1$ assigns a probability of 0.3 to $w_c$, and assigns 0.35, 0.35, 0 and 0 to the remaining words; $L_2$ assigns a probability of 0.25 to $w_c$, and assigns 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 and 0.15 to the remaining words. In this example, $w_c$ is given a higher probability by $L_1$ but ranked higher by $L_2$.} \\
%
%Guessing entropy is a metric which focuses more on the final ordering of the word predictions made by a language model. It is defined as the binary logarithm of how far down a list of predictions (when sorted by probability) the actual next word is, averaged across the test data.

\subsubsection{Average-Keys-Saved}

It is typical for the top three next-word predictions to be displayed and updated as the user types in a mobile keyboard, as described in section \todo{XXX}. Clearly, it is in the interest of the mobile keyboard developer to minimise the amount of typing a user has to do before the correct prediction is displayed. Average-keys-saved is based on this incentive, and is defined as the number of keys that the user would be saved from typing as a result of the correct next word appearing in the top three predictions, averaged over the number of characters in the test data. \\

As an example, if the user is typing \ttt{science} and the word \ttt{science} appears in the top three predictions after they have typed \ttt{sc}, then that would count as 5 characters being saved, averaging at $\frac{5}{7}$ keys saved per character. Averaging over the number of characters in the test data ensures that the results are not biased by the data containing particularly long words, which are easier to save characters on.

\subsubsection{Memory Usage}

This is measured as the amount of physical memory in megabytes occupied by the process in which the language model under test is instantiated.

\subsubsection{Average Inference Time}

This is measured as the amount of time in milliseconds that the language model takes to assign a probability to all of the words in its vocabulary given a sequence of words, averaged over a large number of sequences.

\subsection{Datasets}

I used three datasets throughout the evaluation of my project:

\subsubsection{Penn Tree Bank (PTB) Dataset}

The Penn Tree Bank is a popular dataset for measuring the quality of language models, created from text from the Wall Street Journal. It has already been preprocessed such that numbers are replaced with \ttt{N}, rare words are replaced with \ttt{<unk>} and the text has been split up into one sentence per line. It has been split up into a training, validation and test set. The training set has 10,000 unique words and 887,521 words overall. \\

Given that the Penn Tree Bank is so widely adopted, I used it for all tests in which the size of the training data is fixed, and will refer to it as PTB.

\subsubsection{One Billion Word (1BW) Benchmark}

This is a much larger dataset produced by Google of approximately 1 billion words \cite{1bw:chelba2013}. I used this dataset for tests in which the size of the training data is a variable under investigation, and will refer to it as 1BW.

\subsubsection{Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC)}

The Cambridge Learner Corpus is a dataset of 1,244 exam scripts written by candidates sitting the Cambridge ESOL First Certificate in English (FCE) examination in 2000 and 2001 \cite{clc:yannakoudakis2011}. The original dataset contains the scripts annotated with corrections to all of the mistakes by the candidates. In this project I make use of a preprocessed version of the dataset, in which there is one file containing the error-free version of the exam scripts and there is another file containing the original exam scripts with their errors. These two files are aligned line by line. I used this dataset when exploring the performance of language models on error-prone text, and will refer to it as CLC.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Existing Models}

\subsubsection*{Smoothing techniques and the value of $n$ in $n$-gram models}

The first set of language models that I built were $n$-gram models, along with a series of smoothing techniques for improving their predictions on less frequent $n$-grams.

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Cross-entropy of $n$-gram models trained on the PTB dataset.}
\end{figure}

Recall from equation (4.2) that cross-entropy is just the binary logarithm of perplexity, and that lower perplexity scores indicate better prediction accuracy. With this in mind, it is clear that modified Kneser-Ney smoothing offers the best prediction performance amongst the $n$-gram models. \\

The change in performance with the value of $n$ is interesting. Intuitively, one might expect that increasing $n$ will always yield better results, because this corresponds to increasing the number of words you use to make a prediction. However, for $n$-gram models with no smoothing, add-one smoothing or Katz smoothing, this is not the case. For $n$-gram models with add-one or no smoothing, this is because they do not employ backoff. At higher values of $n$, $n$-grams are much more sparse, so without any backoff higher $n$-gram models can only rely on sparse counts, resulting is lower probabilities being assigned to plausible sequences of words. Katz smoothing does employ backoff, and achieves much better performance, but it still distributes too much probability to rare $n$-grams.

\subsubsection*{A comparison of RNN-based models with $n$-gram models}

As described in the implementation chapter, I also implemented three RNN-based language models which differ in the RNN cell architecture: vanilla RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit and Long Short-Term Memory.

	Plot perplexity (or cross-entropy) and average-keys-saved as a function of the amount of training data used.

Points to discuss:
\begin{itemize}
\item
	Average-keys-saved and guessing entropy taken over first 1000 words, whereas perplexity over whole test set.
\item
	Note $n$-gram models are unpruned (hence large size).
\item
	Katz beaten by absolute-discounting-derived methods on all fronts.
\item
	Modified Kneser-Ney only offers marginal gain in perplexity.
\item
	Reduction in performance of $n$-gram, add-one and Katz with N, due to sparsity of $n$-grams at higher lengths.
\item
	Combination via average.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{On a Mobile Device}

Incorporating an RNN-based language model implementation into a mobile keyboard, as described in section \todo{XXX}, presented a different series of challenges. The strict memory and CPU limitations of App Extensions in iOS forced me to explore the tradeoffs between resource consumption and prediction performance. \\

As shown in figure \todo{XXX}, the vanilla RNN architecture presents the smallest memory overhead, and so this is what I use in the following experiments. I investigated the effect of both vocabulary size and the number of hidden neurons on the memory usage and the average-keys-saved:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    scale only axis,
    xmin=0,xmax=5,
    ymin=0,ymax=1,
    axis y line=left,
    ymajorgrids=true,
    grid style=dashed,
    xlabel=Minimum frequency,
    ylabel=Average-keys-saved]
  \end{axis}
  \begin{axis}[
    scale only axis,
    xmin=0,xmax=50,
    ymin=0,ymax=1,
    axis x line=top,
    axis y line=none,
    xmajorgrids=true,
    grid style=dashed,
    xlabel=Memory (MB)]
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}


Here, I want to focus on the tradeoff between accuracy and resource consumption. Specifically, I could look at the following: \\
\begin{itemize}
\item
	The effect of increasing the minimum frequency for a word to be considered in the vocabulary. (I.e. the effect of changing the vocabulary size).
\item
	The effect of changing the number of hidden layer neurons.
\item
	The effect of using RNN vs GRU vs LSTM.
\item
	(Perhaps also the effect of pruning on $n$-gram models).
\item
	ALSO: Perhaps compare using float 32 vs float 16 in terms of memory vs accuracy.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{The trade-off between the vocabulary size and resource usage}
\subsubsection*{The trade-off between the number of hidden neurons and resource usage}
\subsubsection*{The trade-off between the number of hidden neurons and resource usage}

Other optimisations (not graphed):
\begin{itemize}
\item
	Remove softmax layer.
\item
	Store weights as float 16 rather than float 32.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{On Error-Prone Text}

I split the CLC dataset up into six files:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c}
	\ttt{train.correct.txt} & \ttt{train.incorrect.txt} \\
	\ttt{valid.correct.txt} & \ttt{valid.incorrect.txt} \\
	\ttt{test.correct.txt} & \ttt{test.incorrect.txt}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The training, validation and test sets all consisted of one file containing uncorrected text and another file containing the corresponding corrected text. I trained an 2-layer LSTM-based language model with 256 hidden neurons on \ttt{train.correct.txt}, and used \ttt{valid.correct.txt} to guide the learning rate decay. I filtered the test set files such that they only contained pairs of lines that were not identical and that did not contain any insertion or deletion corrections. \\

Before exploring ways to improve the performance on error-prone text, I first established an approximate upper and lower bound. To obtain the upper bound (i.e. the best possible perplexity), I evaluated the LSTM using \ttt{test.correct.txt} for the input words and \ttt{test.correct.txt} for the target words. and 'In order to establish a rough upper and lower bound on the performance of the LSTM on error-prone text, I first evaluated 

Things I aim to evaluate here are: \\

\begin{itemize}
\item
	The hypothetical upper and lower bounds on accuracy (i.e. the LM results on correct input and on incorrect input respectively).
\item
	The effect of using the vocabulary vs different sized dictionaries for determining if a word should be replaced or not.
\item
	The effect of edit distance on performance.
\item
	An intuitive explanation behind the gap remaining between the current performance and the upper bound. Perhaps some suggestions for future work.
\end{itemize}
